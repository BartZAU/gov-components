## instructions

Identify a component that the NSW Design System may be missing and create it. You will have 10 minutes to present your component, explain the considerations behind why you chose it and how you were planning to build it. We expect to see snippets of code and proposed design/variations. It doesnâ€™t need to be polished - we just want to see a glimpse of how you think and work. We expect you to spend 2-3 hours preparing for your presentation.
